## Getting started:

1. Clone this repository
2. Edit the config file (options explained in [#options](#options))
3. On first install, run `npm install`
4. Run `node HalloweenSniper.js`

## Features:

### Claim Delay

Controlled by `minWait` and `maxWait` in config.yaml. The bot will delay for a random amount of time between `minWait` and `maxWait` before claiming the point.

### Sabotage

When enabled, the selfbot will respond to the `Trick'cord Treat#1944` bot with the wrong phrase, causing it to leave and award no points to anyone.

### Spam

When enabled, the selfbot will send a message every {$spamInterval} seconds. Doing this can lead to the `Trick'cord Treat#1944` bot showing up more often.
